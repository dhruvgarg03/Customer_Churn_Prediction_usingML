# Customer_Churn_Prediction_usingML
Customer churn prediction using machine learning (ML) involves analyzing customer data to identify patterns that indicate a high likelihood of customers discontinuing services or switching to competitors. This predictive approach enables businesses to proactively retain at-risk customers through targeted interventions, reducing financial losses and improving customer satisfaction.
Key Concepts
Customer churn refers to customers ending their relationship with a business, often due to dissatisfaction, competitive offers, or changing needs. ML models address this by:
Processing historical data (e.g., usage patterns, demographics, transaction history) to identify risk factors.
Classifying customers into "churn" or "non-churn" categories using binary classification techniques.
Providing actionable insights to guide retention strategies, such as personalized offers or service improvements.
